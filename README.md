Just my personal fork of https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole

Most of the branches I'm making pull requests for into the original.

So far includes:

- **webserverchoices**: Allows choosing manual web server configuration (for use with a web server you have brought up yourself).
- **dnsports**: Allows specifying a custom port for a custom DNS server.
- **networkchoices**: Work properly with interfaces with multiple IPv4 addresses.  Allow the user to keep their current network reconfiguration.
- **Feature/ryt51V-sudo**: Better handling of sudo and the pihole user.
- **ryt51V-improveddialog**: Just what the dialog should be IMO.
